## Migrating from ollo69/ha-samsungtv-smart

This fork is a drop-in replacement for ollo69's integration. Migration is straightforward and preserves entity IDs, automations, and all existing configuration.

### Before you start

- Note down your custom **source list**, **app list**, and **channel list** for each TV: Settings → Integrations → SamsungTV Smart → Configure
- Have your **SmartThings credentials** ready (API key or OAuth token)
- Optionally, install [Spook](https://github.com/frenck/spook) — it will flag any broken entity references after migration, saving you a lot of manual checking

### Migration steps

1. **Remove ollo69's integration** for each TV via Settings → Integrations → SamsungTV Smart → Delete. Do not rename or remove any entities beforehand.

2. **Uninstall ollo69 via HACS** — go to HACS → Integrations, find the ollo69 integration and remove it. Then **verify** that the `samsungtv_smart` folder is gone from your `config/custom_components/` directory (use File Editor or SSH). If it still exists, delete it manually.

   > ⚠️ This step is critical: when migrating between two integrations sharing the same domain (`samsungtv_smart`), HACS can sometimes remove the newly installed files when uninstalling the old one. Always confirm the folder is absent before reinstalling.

3. **Restart Home Assistant** before proceeding. This ensures the old domain is fully cleared from HA's internal registry.

4. **Install this fork** via HACS (add `https://github.com/TheFab21/ha-samsungtv-smart` as a custom repository, see [Installation](#installation)), then restart Home Assistant again.

5. **Verify files are on disk** before trying to add the integration:
   ```bash
   ls /config/custom_components/samsungtv_smart/
   ```
   If the folder is missing or empty despite HACS showing the integration as "Downloaded", use the HACS 3-dot menu → **Redownload** to force a fresh install.

6. **Add each TV** using the badge below or via Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration → search **SamsungTV Smart**. Use the **exact same device name** as before — this preserves your entity IDs (e.g. `media_player.living_room_tv`).

7. **Re-enter your SmartThings credentials** when prompted. OAuth2 is recommended for a maintenance-free setup (see [SmartThings Authentication](#smartthings-authentication)).

8. **Restore your source, app, and channel lists** via Settings → Integrations → SamsungTV Smart → Configure for each TV. The format is identical to ollo69.

9. If any entity ID got a `_2` suffix, rename it back via Settings → Entities.

### Key differences from ollo69

- **Art Mode**: use the dedicated `switch.<tv_name>_art_mode` entity to toggle Art Mode instead of the `set_art_mode` service. The switch is more reliable and works consistently across all Frame TV models, including multi-TV setups.
- **Picture mode**: a new `select.<tv_name>_picture_mode` entity is available. If you had automations calling `samsungtv_smart.select_picture_mode`, they continue to work.
- **SmartThings authentication**: OAuth2 is now available and strongly recommended over Personal Access Tokens (PATs expire after 24 hours).
- **Frame 2024 TVs**: source list and picture mode detection are fixed via REST fallbacks — no manual workarounds needed.

---

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add a custom repository.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_custom_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_custom_repository/?owner=TheFab21&repository=ha-samsungtv-smart&category=integration)

Or manually add the custom repository in HACS:
1. Go to **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/TheFab21/ha-samsungtv-smart` as **Integration**
3. Search for **SamsungTV Smart** and install


### Manual

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `samsungtv_smart` folder into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:

   ```
   config/
   └── custom_components/
       └── samsungtv_smart/
   ```

3. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Configuration

### SmartThings Authentication

> ⚠️ **Upcoming SmartThings API pricing change.** Samsung has announced that the
> SmartThings API will move to paid tiers, with free access phasing out around
> **October 2026** (a **$4.99/month "Personal" plan** with a monthly call quota
> for individual/non-commercial developers, plus separate commercial tiers —
> exact quotas not yet published). All SmartThings features of this integration
> (picture mode, channel/app info, sound mode, etc.) call the SmartThings API
> **under your own Samsung account**, so this may eventually apply to you, not
> just to the project itself. Nothing changes today and no code changes are
> required yet — this integration still works exactly as before. We're tracking
> the published quotas and will document any impact (e.g. reducing polling
> frequency) once Samsung releases the details. See the
> [SmartThings blog post](https://blog.smartthings.com/smartthings-updates/a-new-enhanced-smartthings-api-experience/)
> for the announcement.

Three methods are available. Choose **one**.

---

#### Option 1 — OAuth2 (Recommended)

This method authenticates via your Samsung account. Tokens are refreshed automatically.

**Step 1 — Create a SmartThings OAuth App (one time)**

> ⚠️ The SmartThings Developer Portal web UI no longer supports creating OAuth apps. Use the SmartThings CLI instead.

1. Install the [SmartThings CLI](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/smartthings-cli).
2. Run `smartthings apps:create` and follow the interactive prompts:
   - **Display Name**: `Home Assistant Samsung TV`
   - **Description**: `For Home Assistant integration of Samsung The Frame TV`
   - **Icon Image URL**: leave blank
   - **Target URL**: leave blank
   - **Scopes**: select `r:devices:*` and `x:devices:*`
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
   - Select **Finish and create OAuth-In SmartApp**
3. The CLI will display your app credentials — save the **OAuth Client Id** and **Client Secret**.

> ⚠️ Use the **OAuth Client Id**, NOT the App Id.

**Step 2 — Add Application Credentials in Home Assistant**

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**.
2. Click **⋮ → Application Credentials → + Add Application Credentials**.
3. Select **SamsungTV Smart**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
5. Click **Add**.

> The OAuth2 option will only appear in the integration setup after completing this step.

**Step 3 — Configure the integration**

When adding the integration, select **OAuth2 (Sign in with Samsung)** and follow the login flow.

---

#### Option 2 — Personal Access Token (PAT)

> ⚠️ **Not recommended.** SmartThings Personal Access Tokens have a limited lifetime (24 hours). When the token expires, SmartThings features will stop working silently and you will need to manually generate a new token and reconfigure the integration. Consider using **OAuth2** or **SmartThings Integration Link** for a maintenance-free setup.

1. Go to [https://account.smartthings.com/tokens](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens).
2. Create a new token with at least **Devices** permissions.
3. Copy the token.
4. When adding the integration, select **Personal Access Token** and paste it.

---

#### Option 3 — SmartThings Integration Link

If you already have the native SmartThings integration configured in Home Assistant:

1. When adding the integration, select **Personal Access Token**.
2. In the dropdown, select your existing SmartThings integration instead of entering a token manually.

---

### Integration Setup

[![Start Setup](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=samsungtv_smart)

Click the badge above to open the config flow directly, or follow these steps manually:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration**.
2. Search for **SamsungTV Smart** and select it.
3. Choose your authentication method (see above).
4. Enter your **TV's IP address** (a static IP or DHCP reservation is strongly recommended).
5. Follow the on-screen steps. Your TV may prompt you to accept the pairing request — accept it.

> **Note**: Custom integrations installed via HACS do not appear under the "Samsung" brand group in the Add Integration search. If you can't find "SamsungTV Smart" in the search results, use the badge above — it opens the config flow directly regardless.

> **Tip**: If your TV is off and you are using Wake-on-LAN, make sure WOL is enabled in your TV's network settings.

---

### Options

After initial setup, click **Configure** on the integration card to access these options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Source list** | Define custom input sources (JSON: `{"HDMI 1": "KEY_HDMI1", ...}`) |
| **App list** | Define custom app shortcuts (JSON) |
| **App load method** | How to load the app list: All, Default, or Disabled |
| **App launch method** | Standard, Remote, or REST |
| **Power on method** | Wake-on-LAN or SmartThings |
| **WOL repeat count** | Number of WOL packets sent (1–5) |
| **Scan interval** | SmartThings polling interval (seconds) |
| **Use ST channel info** | Fetch live channel info from SmartThings |
| **Use ST status info** | Fetch power/input status from SmartThings |
| **Show channel number** | Display channel number alongside channel name |
| **Use mute check** | Detect mute state via SmartThings |
| **Logo option** | Show logos for apps/channels (local or remote) |
| **Sync turn on/off** | Optional entity to mirror TV power state |
| **External power entity** | Use an external sensor to determine power state |
| **Toggle Art Mode** | Toggle Art Mode when turning on a Frame TV that is already in Art Mode |
| **Ping port** | Port used to detect TV presence |
| **WS name** | Name shown on the TV when pairing (default: `[Home Assistant]`) |

> **IP Control moved.** Pairing and the *Enable IP Control* / *Enable IP Control Art Mode* toggles are no longer in this Options screen — they now live under **Reconfigure → IP Control** (see [Reconfigure](#reconfigure) below).

---
### How control works — and what *App launch method* actually does

These are two different layers. Don't confuse the **App launch method** option with how
the integration *connects* to the TV.

#### App launch method (an option — app launching only)

The **App launch method** option (*Standard / Remote / REST*) only decides which channel is
used to **launch an application**. It has no effect on power, keys, volume, sources or Art Mode.

| Value | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Standard** | `ms.application.start` over the control WebSocket channel (falls back to remote). Recommended. |
| **Remote** | `ed.apps.launch` over the remote WebSocket channel (same channel as key presses). |
| **REST** | `POST /api/v2/applications/{id}` over HTTP. Deprecated by Samsung on recent Tizen — often a no-op on 2022+ sets, and the integration reports success even when nothing launched. |

> **Recommendation:** leave this on **Standard**. Switch to **Remote** only if a specific app
> won't launch. **REST** is mainly relevant to older TVs.

#### Connection layers (the architecture — they coexist)

The integration does **not** pick a single connection mechanism. Three layers run together,
each with its own job:

| Layer | Transport | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **WebSocket** | Local, ports 8001/8002 | Primary control: power, keys, volume, sources, app launching, and Frame Art Mode. |
| **SmartThings** | Cloud (OAuth2 / PAT) | Status polling (power, input, channel, picture/sound mode) and optional power-on. Read-mostly — not a local command channel. |
| **IP Control** | Local JSON-RPC, port 1516 | Optional. Reliable power on/off without SmartThings, plus optional Art Mode control. Paired and toggled under [Reconfigure](#reconfigure). |

> The three layers are complementary, not alternatives. *App launch method* sits **on top of**
> the WebSocket layer (two of its three values are WebSocket channels); it is not a fourth
> connection mechanism.
>
> ---
> 
### Reconfigure

To change connection or credentials after setup, open **Settings → Devices & Services → Samsung TV Smart → Reconfigure**. The flow is split into three clear sections so you only touch what you need:

| Section | What it changes |
|---|---|
| **Connection** | TV IP address and WebSocket port (8001, or 8002 for SSL-only TVs). Use **8001** unless your TV only answers on **8002**. The integration also falls back between the two ports automatically at runtime if a firmware update filters the configured one. |
| **Authentication** | The auth method (OAuth2 / Personal Access Token / SmartThings link). For OAuth2, selecting it starts the login flow immediately. |
| **IP Control** | Pair the local JSON-RPC channel (port 1516) and, once paired, toggle **Enable IP Control** (reliable power on/off without SmartThings) and **Enable IP Control Art Mode** (⚠️ off by default — see the warning below). To pair, check *Pair now* with the TV **ON and in normal viewing (not Art Mode)** and accept the on-screen prompt. |

> ⚠️ **Do not enable *Enable IP Control Art Mode*** unless you know your firmware handles it — it can break Art Mode entirely and may need a factory reset to recover (seen on QE55LS03D fw 2123). See [IP Control reports Art Mode "on" when it isn't](#ip-control-reports-art-mode-on-when-it-isnt).

---

## Entities

Each configured TV creates the following entities:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `media_player.<tv_name>` | Media Player | Main TV control entity |
| `switch.<tv_name>_art_mode` | Switch | Toggle Art Mode on/off (Frame TVs only) |
| `sensor.<tv_name>_frame_art` | Sensor | Currently displayed artwork info (Frame TVs only) |
| `sensor.<tv_name>_personal` / `_store` / `_other` | Sensor | Thumbnail folder size (MB) per subdirectory, with a `file_list` attribute for gallery cards (Frame TVs only, auto-created in v7) |
| `select.<tv_name>_picture_mode` | Select | Change picture mode (Standard, Movie, etc.) |

> **Note:** The `folder-gallery-card` Lovelace card is bundled with this integration and registered automatically. No manual installation or resource configuration required.

### Media Player Attributes

In addition to standard media player attributes, the following are available:

- `device_model`, `device_name`, `device_os`, `device_mac`
- `picture_mode`, `picture_mode_list`
- `sound_mode`, `sound_mode_list`
- `channel`, `channel_name`, `channel_number`
- `app_id`, `app_name`
- `frame_art_mode` — whether Art Mode is active
- `frame_art_current` — content ID of the current artwork

### Frame Art Sensor Attributes

- `art_mode` — current Art Mode state
- `content_id` — artwork content ID
- `content_type` — artwork category
- `thumbnail_url` — local URL to the thumbnail (if downloaded)

---

## Services

data:
  media_content_type: send_key
  media_content_id: KEY_MUTE
```

---

### Frame Art Services

These services require a Samsung **Frame TV** with Art Mode. They are called on the `media_player` entity.

| Service | Description |

| `samsungtv_smart.art_set_auto_rotation` | Configure auto-rotation (duration, shuffle, category). Alias of `art_set_slideshow` — works on older Frames that don't support the slideshow API |

#### Service Examples

**Select an artwork:**

```yaml
action: samsungtv_smart.art_select_image
target:
  entity_id: media_player.samsung_frame
data:
  content_id: SAM-F0206
  show: true
```

**Upload a local image:**

```yaml
action: samsungtv_smart.art_upload
target:
  entity_id: media_player.samsung_frame
data:
  file_path: /config/www/my_art.jpg
  matte_id: modern_apricot
  file_type: jpg
```

**Batch download thumbnails:**

```yaml
action: samsungtv_smart.art_get_thumbnails_batch
target:
  entity_id: media_player.samsung_frame
data:
  category_id: MY-C0002
  favorites_only: false
  force_download: false
```

**Configure slideshow:**

```yaml
action: samsungtv_smart.art_set_slideshow
target:
  entity_id: media_player.samsung_frame
data:
  duration: 15min
  shuffle: true
  category_id: 2
```

> **Note on Frame generations.** The slideshow feature uses different underlying
> APIs depending on firmware: newer Frames (2024+) use `slideshow_status`, while
> older Frames (≈2020–2021) only support `auto_rotation_status`. The integration
> detects which one your TV speaks on first use and routes automatically, so
> `art_set_slideshow` and `art_set_auto_rotation` are interchangeable aliases —
> use either. `duration` accepts the presets (`3min`, `15min`, `1h`, `12h`, `1d`,
> `7d`) or any integer number of minutes (e.g. `30`, `180`); some models reject
> values outside their supported set.

---

## Frame Art Mode

### Overview

Frame TVs can display artwork when not in use. This integration provides full programmatic control over the Art Mode, including artwork selection, brightness, matting, filters, and slideshow settings.

### Content IDs

Artworks are identified by content IDs:

| Prefix | Source |
|---|---|
| `SAM-*` | Samsung Art Store content |
| `MY_F*` | User-uploaded photos |
| `MY-C*` | Categories (MY-C0002=My Photos, MY-C0004=Favorites, MY-C0008=All) |

### Matte Styles

Format: `type_color`

> ⚠️ Available matte types and colors are **retrieved dynamically from your TV** at startup and vary by model and firmware. The `select.samsung_*_matte_type` and `select.samsung_*_matte_color` entities are populated automatically with the options your TV actually supports. Call `samsungtv_smart.art_get_matte_list` to see the full list for your device.

**Example** (QE55LS03D 2024): `modern_apricot`, `shadowbox_polar`

### Photo Filters

Available filters: `none`, `mono`, `original`, `ink`, `watercolor`, `oil`, `pastel`, `posterize`, `noir`, `quartertone`

### Thumbnail Downloads

Thumbnails are automatically organized and saved to a **per-TV** directory keyed
by the config-entry ID (new in v7 — see the v7 changelog for migration notes):

```
config/www/frame_art/{entry_id}/
├── current.jpg  ← currently displayed artwork
├── personal/    ← user-uploaded photos (MY-F*)
├── store/       ← Samsung Art Store (SAM-*)
└── other/       ← everything else
```

Find your `{entry_id}` on the `sensor.<tv_name>_frame_art` entity (Developer
Tools → States) — it's exposed as the `entry_id` attribute, and the ready-to-use
URL base is in `thumbnail_folder`.

These are accessible via Home Assistant's `/local/` URL path, making them
directly usable in Lovelace dashboards and galleries.

**Smart caching**: thumbnails are only downloaded once. Subsequent calls to
`art_get_thumbnail` or `art_get_thumbnails_batch` skip files that already exist,
making batch operations fast on repeat runs. Use `force_download: true` to
override.

**Resilient `current.jpg`**: if a live thumbnail fetch for the current artwork
fails (a transient TV/WebSocket hiccup), the integration reuses a previously
downloaded copy of that artwork as `current.jpg` instead of showing an error
placeholder. (Contributed by @prestonmcafee.)

## Automations & Tips

### Wake-on-LAN with delayed command

Samsung TVs may need a moment to become responsive after WOL. Use a delay in automations:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on TV and switch to HDMI 1"
    trigger:
      - platform: ...
    action:
      - service: media_player.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.samsung_tv
      - delay: "00:00:08"
      - service: media_player.select_source
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.samsung_tv
        data:
          source: HDMI 1
```

### Preventive maintenance (integration reload)

To prevent WebSocket connection saturation over time, you can schedule a periodic reload:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Reload SamsungTV integration nightly"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "03:00:00"
    action:
      - service: homeassistant.reload_config_entry
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.samsung_tv
```

### Art Mode automation on TV off

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Enable Art Mode when TV turns off"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: media_player.samsung_frame
        to: "off"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.samsung_frame_art_mode
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Integration not appearing in Add Integration

Custom integrations installed via HACS do not appear under branded groups (e.g. "Samsung") in the Add Integration search. Use the badge in [Integration Setup](#integration-setup) to open the config flow directly, or search for `samsungtv` (not `samsung`) in the search box.

If the config flow still fails with *"This integration cannot be added from the UI"*, the most likely cause is that the integration files are missing from disk despite HACS showing it as installed — a known issue when migrating from ollo69 (same domain, same folder name).

**Verify files are present:**
```bash
ls /config/custom_components/samsungtv_smart/
```

If the folder is missing or empty, use HACS → SamsungTV Smart → ⋮ → **Redownload**, select the version explicitly, then restart Home Assistant.

If the folder exists but the flow still fails, enable DEBUG logging and check for errors on startup:
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.samsungtv_smart: debug
```

### TV not found during setup

- Make sure the TV is on and connected to the same network as Home Assistant.
- Ensure the TV's IP address is correct and reachable (`ping <ip>`).
- Disable any VLANs or firewall rules blocking ports **8001** and **8002**.

### TV accepts pairing but integration shows unavailable

- The first pairing token is stored in the config entry. If the token is rejected, delete the integration and re-add it — the TV will prompt again for pairing.
- Make sure you **Accept** the pairing request on the TV screen within the timeout window.

### WebSocket connectivity issues / TV becomes unresponsive

Samsung TVs have strict limits on simultaneous WebSocket connections. If the integration creates too many connections without properly closing them, the TV's SmartThings service can become saturated.

Signs of this issue:
- TV stops responding to commands
- Logs show repeated `WebSocketProtocolException` or connection refused errors
- Issue resolves temporarily after a TV restart

Mitigations built into this fork:
- Proper handling of invalid WebSocket close opcodes

### Recurring "IP Control state read failed" / "Host is unreachable" errors

If your log shows repeated errors like this, spaced minutes apart, for a TV that is otherwise powered on and working:

```
Error fetching IP Control state <name> data: IP Control state read failed:
transport failure talking to <ip>:1516: [Errno 113] Host is unreachable
Error fetching IP Control state <name> data: IP Control state read failed:
transport failure talking to <ip>:1516: timed out
```

These are network-layer errors (the TV briefly becomes unreachable at the IP
level), not something the integration can retry around — it just means the
TV's network connection dropped for a moment.

The most common cause is a **DHCP lease renewal hiccup**: even with a DHCP
reservation, a short or unstable lease can cause brief unreachability when it
renews. The fix is to **configure a fully static IP on the TV itself**
instead of relying on a router-side reservation:

- On the TV: **Settings → General → Network → Network Status/Settings → IP Settings → Manual**, and enter the IP, subnet, gateway and DNS yourself.

This removes DHCP renewal from the equation entirely. If the errors persist
after switching to a static IP, also check the network switch port the TV is
plugged into (port resets, re-negotiation, rising CRC/error counters point to
a cabling/port issue rather than the integration).

### "Host is unreachable" / connection-failure logs only when the TV is OFF

If the errors above happen **only while a TV is powered off** (and stop once it's
on), this is expected behaviour for some Frames — **not** a bug or a network
problem.

Older Frames (notably the **2020 and 2021** models) **drop off the network
entirely in standby**: their network chip powers down, so they stop answering
*everything* incoming — ping, IP Control (port 1516) and the Art WebSocket. From
the integration's side that's indistinguishable from "the TV is simply off", so a
read failure there just means the TV is off. (2024+ Frames keep their network
interface alive in standby and still answer a ping, so they don't show this.)

You can confirm which case you have: with the TV off, `ping <tv-ip>` from any
machine. No reply → that TV goes fully off the network in standby, and the
off-state log lines are normal.

Recent versions already keep this quiet: while a TV is off, IP Control transport
failures and Art channel connection failures are logged at **DEBUG** (with at most
a single INFO line), not ERROR/WARNING — so real problems still stand out.

**"Then how does Home Assistant turn it back on if it's off the network?"** — it
doesn't *reach* the TV, it *pushes* a wake signal, and neither path needs the TV
to be reachable:

- **SmartThings (cloud):** even in deep standby the TV keeps an *outbound*
  connection to Samsung's cloud (an always-on part, separate from the main
  network stack). The power-on command goes to the SmartThings cloud, which pushes
  it down that channel.
- **Wake-on-LAN:** the network card's WoL engine listens for a magic packet at the
  Ethernet level even while the OS network stack is down; a magic packet expects no
  reply, so it works on a TV that won't answer a ping.

Set the wake method per TV with the **Power On Method** option (Wake-on-LAN by
default; SmartThings or IP Control also available).

### SmartThings features not working

- Verify your API key/token has `Devices` permissions.
- Check that your TV is registered and visible in the SmartThings app.
- For OAuth2: confirm your Developer Portal app is still active and has the correct scopes (`r:devices:*`, `x:devices:*`).

### OAuth2 — "Token refresh failed"

If the SmartThings OAuth token can no longer be refreshed, the integration raises
an alert in **Settings → Repairs** ("SmartThings authentication failed for …")
explaining the cause and pointing you to the fix. The alert clears automatically
once authentication is restored. To recover:

1. Check internet connectivity from Home Assistant.
2. Verify your OAuth app is still active by running `smartthings apps` in the SmartThings CLI.
3. Re-authenticate: go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Samsung TV Smart → Reconfigure**.

A refresh token can become invalid if it is revoked, expires, or is rotated by
SmartThings (which can happen after repeated re-authentication). Reconfiguring
issues a fresh token pair.

### Source list empty on Frame 2024 TVs

The SmartThings `supportedInputSources` attribute returns empty on some 2024 Frame TV models. This fork automatically falls back to a REST API call (`samsungvd.mediaInputSource`) to retrieve the full source list with custom names. If sources still appear missing, check that SmartThings is properly configured and the TV is reachable.

### Picture mode not updating after change

SmartThings caches the picture mode value. This fork automatically sends a `refresh` command after any `setPictureMode` call to force the TV to report the new value. If the `select` entity still shows a stale value, wait a few seconds for the next poll cycle.

### Frame Art services not working

- These services require a Samsung **Frame** TV with Art Mode capability.
- Make sure the TV is on (not just in Art Mode).
- Check that port **8002** (encrypted WebSocket) is not blocked.

### Art Mode fails briefly after TV wakes from standby

When the TV wakes from standby (e.g. via an automation), the WebSocket connection needs a short time to re-establish before the Art API becomes available. This is normal — the integration will self-recover within a minute. If you experience consistent failures in morning automations, add a 60–90 second delay after the TV turns on before triggering Art Mode commands.

### IP Control reports Art Mode "on" when it isn't

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not enable *Enable IP Control Art Mode* unless you know your firmware handles it correctly.** On affected firmwares it can leave **Art Mode completely broken** (detection stuck/flickering, switching unreliable) — and the damage can persist at the TV level, requiring a **factory reset** to recover. This was observed on a **QE55LS03D with firmware 2123**. The option is **off by default**; leave it off and use the WebSocket / Frame Art path, which is unaffected. Power on/off over IP Control is a separate setting and is **not** impacted.

On some Frame TVs the local IP Control (JSON-RPC, port 1516) `artModeControl` flag can **wedge "on"**: it keeps returning `artModeOn` even when the TV is on a real input (e.g. HDMI), so `art_mode_status` is reported as `on` permanently or flickers between `on` and `off`. The flag is wrong at the source — the same value is returned even when querying the TV directly, outside Home Assistant. The actual panel state in that situation is given by `getTVStates.pictureMode` (`Ambient` only while art is really on the panel).

This typically appears **after a TV factory reset and re-pairing** of the IP Control channel, and looks like a TV firmware fault.

**Workarounds, in order of preference:**

1. **Disable Art Mode over IP Control.** Under **Reconfigure → IP Control**, turn **Enable IP Control Art Mode** off (this is the default). Art Mode detection and switching then fall back to the WebSocket / Frame Art channel, which is unaffected. Power on/off over IP Control (**Enable IP Control** / the *IP Control* power-on method) keeps working — only the Art Mode path is disabled.
2. **Factory reset the TV.** If you need IP Control for Art Mode and the flag is wedged, the only known way to clear the stuck `artModeControl` flag on the TV side is a **factory reset of the TV** (Settings → General → Reset), followed by re-pairing. There is no remote/API command that unsticks it.

Once a firmware update reports `artModeControl` correctly again, you can re-enable **Enable IP Control Art Mode** under **Reconfigure → IP Control**.
